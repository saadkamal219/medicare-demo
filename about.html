        <p><snap class="m">Medi</snap><snap class="c">care</snap>, the platform that serves the most precious, most valuable products that is worth of any value when it is needed, <strong>Medical Products</strong>. But the rise of this platform has also a story that points to such a failure that I, the <strong>CEO</strong> of this company, can not recover by any means. Let's have some moment while you read the rising story of this industry, emotional enough but we hope you will find out the message behind the story.<br><br>
        <strong>Perspactive of <snap style="color: #0caa0c">Saad</snap> [ <strong>CEO,</strong> <snap style="color: #0caa0c">Medi</snap><snap style="color: #FF8080">care</snap> ]</strong><br><br>

        That was 2012, the previous night of Eid-Ul-Azha. At late evening, I woke up and found my parents crying. I was so little to know everything except the news that my grandmother passed away. When I grew up, I was able to know the incident of that night. My parents and my uncles rushed to the medical centers and hospitals available that night for an oxygen cylinder to save my grandmother but none of the institutions could manage that. So, they managed to shift her to Dhaka and it was too late that she passed away in ambulance. That was the failure, the oxygen cylinder at the peak moment.<br><br>
        When I was at intermidiate level, I hated to be a computer engineer. My wish was to be a veterinary doctor. But somehow I got admitted in <strong>Daffodil International University</strong>, in <strong>Department of Computer Science and Engineering</strong>. I had a course at 2nd Semester, <strong>Business Aplication & Design</strong>. That course was mainly about encountering students to be entrepreneurs and basic UI/UX design, at least to me. <br><br>
        From that course, mainly, I learnt the steps to release a product and how to build that up. And from that day, I dreamt of a this platform to serve the needy people around us so that I can prevent at least one person to be failed as my whole family did. <br><br>
        One last thing, sometimes I hear people saying that there is no opportunity for CSE graduates in Bangladesh. My question to them is if you think there is no opportunity so why don't you create an opportunity for others so that everyone can contribute to our country. I hope you guys get the message I wanted to say.
